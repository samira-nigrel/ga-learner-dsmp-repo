### Project Overview

 Problem statement:
Your friend from Iowa, whose housing problem you solved, is now moving to Melbourne for a new assignment Down Under. As you have solved his Iowa housing problem so well, he wants you to solve his Melbourne housing problem too. Armed with your new-found expertise in regularization, let's work on the Melbourne housing data using regularized regression. Each observation is a different house attribute with various features, like the number of properties that exist in the suburb, land size, building size, governing council for the area, real estate agent, price of the house, etc.



### Learnings from the project

 Outcomes
The main objective of this task is to provide you with an open field where you can practise and work your way with a dataset end to end without any restrictions from our side. So feel free to play around the model until you arrive at your best solution.
In this project, you will apply the following concepts:
Linear Regression
Polynomial Regressor
Lasso Regressor
Ridge Regressor
R^2 Evaluation Metrics
After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of how to build a regularized regression model.
